# free-cuttables
A repo for things I've designed to be cut with a computer-controlled cutter
(I have a Silhouette Cameo), as well as related papercraft-type things.

Any designs uploaded here are free for use (as you probably guessed from the
repository name!)

If you make anything really cool based on these files, I'd love to hear about it!
